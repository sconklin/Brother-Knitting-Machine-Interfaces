These files are related to the Brother KH-930E knitting machine.

This knitting machine can save data to an external floppy disk drive, which connects to the machine using a serial cable.

These external floppy drives are difficult to find and expensive, and the physical format of the floppy disks is different than 3.25" PC drives.

The program PDDemulate acts like a floppy drive, and runs on linux machines, allowing you to save and restore data from the knitting machine.

I have figured out most of the formatting of the saved data files, and the tools that I used to do that are also in this repository.

There is also an example of how to generate a text banner in a .png image file, 
which may be useful to some.

The work that I did was based on earlier work by John R. Hogerhuis.

The work that I've done has been extended by others. Please check out the great projects that they have done:
